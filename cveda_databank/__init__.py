Module `cveda_databank` provides shared functions and constants for databank
operations of the `c-VEDA project`_â€”mainly sanity checking of data uploaded
from acquisition centres.

.. _c-VEDA project: https://cveda.nimhans.ac.in

Constants
---------

.. py:data:: PSC2_FROM_PSC1

   This dictionary maps PSC1 codes to PSC2 codes.
   At module initialization, we read PSC1 keys and PSC2 values as 12-digit
   strings from file */cveda/databank/framework/psc/psc2psc_2016-07-12.txt*.

.. py:data:: PSC1_FROM_PSC2

   This dictionary maps PSC2 codes to PSC1 codes.
   At module initialization, we invert :py:data:`PSC2_FROM_PSC1` to build
   this dictionary.

.. py:data:: DOB_FROM_PSC1

   This dictionary maps PSC1 codes to the date of birth of the relevant subject.
   At module initialization, we read date of birth from Psytools questionnaires
   ACE-IQ and PHIR. We discard subjects with inconsistent data.

.. py:data:: SEX_FROM_PSC1

   This dictionary maps PSC1 codes to the sex of the relevant subject.
   At module initialization, we read sex from Psytools questionnaires ACE-IQ,
   PDS and SDIM. We discard subjects with inconsistent data.
