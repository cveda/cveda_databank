"""Generate codes to pseudonymize c-VEDA data.

The algorithm used here is certainly brain-dead. This is not reusable code
but is good enough for a one-shot run. I spent 10 minutes writing and it
took ~ 3 days to generate PSC2 codes for the c-VEDA projects.

    ----------

    digits : int
        Number of digits the code is made of. If needed the string will be

        Minimal Damerau-Levenshtein distance between codes.
